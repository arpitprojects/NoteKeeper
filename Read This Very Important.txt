1.)This project does not emphasis on using the separate database for the user for sake of simplicity. GOOGLE FIREBASE IS used for the authentication
system.


/*READ THIS POINT VERY IMPORTANT*/

2.)RUNNING inde.html directly will not work and 
Use live-server or http-server
You can install it as npm install live-server 

and specify the folder in the command line like 
c:\wamp\www\designBids_challenge\live-server

A new tab will be open in the DEFAULT BROWSER - > 127.0.0.1:8080




 3.)NO SEPARATE DATABSE FILE OR SQL/MONGODB IS needed . AS FIREBASE AND NG-STORAGE IS USED in this project.
 SO, only 2nd step is important.
 
4.)DETAIL ABOUT THE PROJECT IS IN README.md file
